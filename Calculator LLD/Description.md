# 🧮 Machine Coding Round Problem: CLI Calculator

## Problem Title: CLI Calculator — A Simple Command-Line Based Calculator

### Problem Description:

#### You are required to design and implement a command-line calculator application that can perform basic arithmetic operations — addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), and division (/) — on two or more operands.

#### The calculator should:

- Take user input from the command line.
- Parse and evaluate mathematical expressions.
- Handle invalid inputs and runtime errors gracefully.
- Display the result back to the user.

Your implementation should emphasize:

- Clean and modular code (object-oriented preferred)
- Proper error handling
- Extensibility (e.g., new operations can be added easily in the future)
